  <releases>
  <release version="3.14.0" date="2026-01-02">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>
          Added the option to create more lists in the Home Screen besides the Favorites and Latest ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added a representation of a book's completion percentage in the Home Screen lists. It shows as a thin line at the bottom of a book's card which gets longer the closer the last page read was compared to the total number of pages (if the page was the last one, the line will have a 100% length). It'll only appear for books in the history that have also been opened after this feature was added, as it needs some data not stored in the history by previous versions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added expand and collapse buttons to the lists in the Home Screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added a button to open the integrated file browser in the Home Screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added a "Home Screen" section to the preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved PDF page rendering time and image quality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changed some buttons in the reader's toolbar (zoom, pages direction and page mode) so that they now show the icon corresponding to the current state for the corresponding setting and clicking them opens a vertical submenu where the user can choose from all the available options.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed not showing any space between the text and the icon in the list titles in the Home Screen for rtl languages.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release version="3.13.0" date="2025-12-21">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Added some small quality of life improvements to the Home Screen, like drag and drop to sort the favorites list, new options to open the containing folder of a file in one the lists or add one in the recent files list to the favorites one...
          </li>
          <li>
            Added two new theme preferences: one that automatically sets the theme to "ACBR Light" or "ACBR Dark" based on the operative system settings and the other based on the time of day (the time at which the light and dark themes are set can be customized).
          </li>
          <li>
            Added 'Open Containing Folder' entry to the reader's context menu.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed CBZ files containing __MACOSX folders failing to load in the reader and convert in the tools as they included invalid image files. __MACOSX folders are now ignored.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed invalid page images breaking the reader. When the image corresponding to a page can't be loaded it's now replaced by a generic "file not found" page.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release version="3.12.5" date="2025-08-31">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed RSS reader getting stuck when trying to load a no longer valid favorite feed URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed audio player showing above some of the modal windows.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed some of the modal windows hiding the toolbar while they were open.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release version="3.12.4" date="2025-08-26">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed convert comic books, extract comic books, convert images and create comic book tools progressively slowing down while processing a large batch of files, which was due to the log text's increasingly bigger length impacting the time it took to update it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed PDF metadata editor getting stuck trying to load data from files with undefined creation and/or modification dates.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release version="3.12.3" date="2025-08-20">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Added a button to open the output folder in the convert comic books, extract comic books, convert images and create comic book tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed PDF metadata editor showing 'undefined' as the value for some entries if they were empty.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed audio player always leaving space for the toolbar when placed at the bottom even in the tools and home screen.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release version="3.12.2" date="2025-08-16">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed failing to open files from the search results of the gutenberg tool in the flatpak version due to lack of write permissions. The cache to store downloaded files is now created in the same folder as the config files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed not being able to use the space bar and the arrow keys to edit the names of the home screen favorites.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed log showing a generic error message when there's not enough free disk space in the temp folder to extract files during conversions (can happen with the default temp folder and moderately big files in the flatpak version, for example).
          </li>
        </ul>
